# Virt-Install
This is a very simple shell script used to automatically install and configure KVM/QEMU & Virt-Manager on most Arch-based Distros.
# Installation
Download the .sh script, open a terminal in the script's download location and run ./virt-install.sh
# Things left to do
1. automatically detect what distro the user is running and download the correct dependencied based on that
2. automatically detect what init system the user is running, to add support for Runit or OpenRC
